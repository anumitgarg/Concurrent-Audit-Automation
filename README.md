# Concurrent-Audit-Automation using Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Algorithms
## Introduction to problem statement

On a daily basis, foreign exchange (FX) transactions data is monitored for compliance with RBI regulations pertaining to confirmation of FX deal. This includes a number of FX deal attributes (e.g. Transaction Reference,  Counterparty Name, Deal Date, Value Date, Primary Currency, Counter Currency, Primary Currency Amount, Counter Currency Amount, etc.). 

On an average, transaction testers have to manually review:
1250-1500 underlying documents with 12-15 attributes in each underlying document resulting in physical verification of 15000-22500 data points.

## Proposed Solution
Therefore we have developed a transaction testing solution that can automate manual review by converting unstructured data in scanned “.pdf” files into structured data followed by comparison with the system generated deal listing.
We have used state of the art machine learning algorithms and
